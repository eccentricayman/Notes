DN: What is needed for two computers to communicate with each other?

OSI 7-Layer Model   
       Used to help conceptualize the different parts of network connections.
    
    
        The top layer is the most concrete, with each subsequent layer becoming more abstract (relying less on the physical connections and more on code).
    
        The Layers:  
            1. Physical  
            2. Data Link  
            3. Network  
            4. Transport  
            5. Session  
            6. Presentation  
            7. Application
    
    If you are working on a particular layer, you should not have to think too much about the other layers.
    

Physical Layer
    
    
        How computers are physically connected.
    
        Things like electrons running across wires, radio signals pulsing through the air...
    
    A brief history of wired connections
    
        Thicknet  
            A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, "vampire taps" go into the cable and leech the data out.
    
        Thinnet  
            A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, T-Junctions used to splice connections.
