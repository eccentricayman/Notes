### XML

- eXtensible Markup Language
- It is not a formatting language (like HTML)
- A framework for creating markup based grammars
- Uses some of the syntactic standards of HTML, like tags and attributes, with a focus on storing and representing data instead of rendering and displaying it.
- An XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with a specific XML language.

### SVG

- Scalable Vector Graphics

- SVG is a specific XML based vector graphics format.

- Vector graphics are images that are not represented as a 2d grid of pixels (raster) but instead as a list of drawing commands (like line, circle, rectangle, curve, â€¦)

- The <svg> element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)

- ```xml
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  	SVG CODE HERE
  </svg>
  ```

- xmlns

  - Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML language being used.
