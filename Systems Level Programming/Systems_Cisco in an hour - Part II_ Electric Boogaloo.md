Physical Layer
    
    
        Token Ring
    
            Each computer is connected in a ring to each other.
    
            Only one computer has command of network resources at a time. This is called "having the token".
    
            The network sends a "token" throughout the ring, which contains the identity of the computer  
            allowed to use the network. All other computers must wait to use the network.
    
        Ethernet
    
            Multiple computers connect to a single hub or switch.
    
            Hub  
                Broadcasts the data to all the computers.
    
            Switch  
                Sends data to a specfic computer.
    
            The more computers you add to an ethernet network the greater the chance of collisions.
