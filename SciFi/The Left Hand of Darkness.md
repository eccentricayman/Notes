# Aim: Is it a good thing to believe that intelligent life could exist in other worlds?

Focus your thinking by writing an answer. What's your argument?



My answer is why not - there's no downside to considering the possibility of intelligent life on other worlds. With that idea, we can open our minds up to new possibilities that involve sapient species outside of the human race, instead of just focusing on the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, we are the only intelligent species, living on a rock.

# Aim: How does LeGuin weave politics and diplomacy into the novel?

LeGuin weaves politics into the novel by creating the premise of a unique planet with it's own political entities; they become involved solely through the fact that they are to be included in the intergalactic treaty organization.
