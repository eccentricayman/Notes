# Aim: Documentmenting your data

**DN: What are the drawbacks to SQL?**

- Its a file, prone to accidental changes
- No backups
- Can be lots of empty columns
- Impossible to dynamically edit the schema
- No specific order



### noSQL

- Graph databses
- Map databases
- Document style databases (mongoDB)



### Document-Oriented Database

- Records in Document Oriented Databases are stored as documents.

- Each document contains all the data that is associated with the given record, in key-value pairs (fields).

- Documents in the same collection do not need to have the same fields.

- Documents that are meant to be stored together are put into collections.

- You do not need to specify the type of data put into each field.

- Fields can contain many different kinds of data, including lists and other documents.	

- Each document has its own primary key usually generated by mongo.

- Example:

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId(7df78ad8902c)
    title: 'MongoDB Overview',
    description: 'MongoDB is no SQL database',
    tags: ['mongodb', 'database', 'NoSQL'],
    likes: 100,
    comments [
      {
        user: 'user1',
    	  message: 'My first comment',
    	  dateCreated: new Date(2011, 1, 20, 2, 15),
    	  like: 0
      },
  	{
        user: 'user2',
        message: 'ayylmao',
        dateCreated: newDate(2013, 1,30, 2, 16),
        like: 5
  	}
    ]
  }
  ```



### Python Usage

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

#running a server at home
client = MongoClient('127.0.0.1')
#create a database, next two lines are equal
database = client['foo']
database = client.foo
#add a collection to the database
coll = database.colection1
#do something to collection
coll['doc1']
```
