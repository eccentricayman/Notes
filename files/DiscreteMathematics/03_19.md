## Cardinality of Sets

- A set that is either finite or has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers is called countable. A set that is not countable is uncountable.
- The set of real numbers is an uncountable set.
- When an infinite set is countable (countably infinite) its cardinality is $\aleph_0$ (where $\aleph$ is aleph, the 1st letter of the Hebrew alphabet). We write $|S| = \aleph_0$ and say that S has cardinality "aleph null".

## Positive Rational Numbers are Countable

- A rational number can be expressed as the ratio of two integers p and q such that q $\ne$ 0.
  - 3/4 is rational.
  - $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.
- Show that positive rational numbers are countable.
- The positive rational numbers are countable since they can be arranged in a sequence.

## Calkin Wilf Sequence

- $ \frac{a}{a+b} \leftarrow \frac{a}{b} \rightarrow \frac{a + b}{b}$
- Numerator is root / parent, denominator is children.
- Left child / right child.
- $q_i + 1 = \frac{1}{2[q_i] - q_i + 1}$
