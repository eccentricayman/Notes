3. Counter-Example
4. Proof by Contradiction



- There is a scheme which allows us to generate all the rational numbers
- F(1) = 1, F(2) = 2, F(3) = $\frac{1}{2}$, F(4) = $\frac{1}{3}$, F(5) = 3, F(6) = 4, F(7) = $\frac{3}{2}$, F(8) = $\frac{2}{3}$, F(9) = $\frac{1}{4}$
- We can write a function to align the set of rationals
- A set of numbers is called <u>countable</u>, if it can be aligned by a function that has the set of counting numbers.
- Examples of countable numbers are
  - The set of rationals (infinite)
  - The set of integers (infinite)
- Examples of uncountable numbers
  - Irrationals
  - Complex numbers
  - Reals
- Binary Tree
  - Calkin-Wilf tree
