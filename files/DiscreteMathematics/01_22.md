- Textbook: Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Rosen 7th Edition.

## Propositions

- A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.


- Examples
  - The Moon is made of green cheese.

## Conjunctions

- The conjunction of propositions p and q is denoted by p ^ q, and
  - T - T = T
  - T - F = F
  - F - T = F
  - F - F = F

## Disjunctions

- The disjunction of propositions p and q is denoted by p v q, and
  - T - T = T
  - T - F = T
  - F - T = T
  - F - F = F

## Implication

- If p and q are propositions, then p &rarr; q is a conditional statement or implication which is read as "if p, then q" and has this truth table
  - T - T = T
  - T - F  = F
  - F - T = T
  - F - F = T

## Different Ways of Expressing p &rarr; q

- if p, **then** q
- **if** p, q
- q **unless** >p
- q **if** p
- q whenever p
- q follows from p
- p implies q
- p only if q
- q when p
- p is sufficient for q
- q is necessary for p
- a necessary condition for p is q
- a sufficient condition for q is p
