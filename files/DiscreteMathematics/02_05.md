## Proof by Contradiction

- Assume that the claim is false, go through the algebra and end up with an absurd statement.

- Theorem: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational

- Proof: Assume that $\sqrt{2}​$  is rational, let $\sqrt{2}​$ = $\frac{p}{q}​$

  $\frac{2}{1} = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$

  $p^2 = 2q^2$

  By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Ever number has a unique factorization as a product of primes)

  We have that p is even which means that we can write p as p = 2m,

  substitute for p in equation 1,

  $(2m)^2 = 2q^2$

  $4m^2 = 2q^2$

  $2m^2 = q^2$ and by a similar argument q is even

  For both p and q to be even, contradicts the fact that p/q is simplified therefore $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

- Question:

  Theorem: $\sqrt{5}$ is irrational

  Proof by contradiction

  Assume that $\sqrt{5}$ is rational, let $\sqrt{5}=\frac{p}{q}$, where $\frac{p}{q}$ is simplified
