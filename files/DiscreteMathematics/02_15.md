$n \ \ \exists \ \ \mathbb{Z}$

<u>Prove</u>

n is an even integer if and only if $3n^2+8$ is even



1. If n is even then $3n^2+8$  is even
2. If  $3n^2+8$*  is even then n is even**

*p    **q



<u>Proof</u>

n = 2k, since n is even

&rarr; $3(2k)^2$ + 8

$3(4k^2)$ + 8

$(12k^2+8)$

$2(6k^2 + 4)$

2m, where m = ($6k^2 + 4$)



<u>Contrapositive</u>

p &rarr; q

$\neg q$ &rarr; $\neg p$

If n is odd then $3n^2+8$ is odd



n = 2k + 1,

$3(2k+1)^2 + 8$

= $3(2k^2 +4k + 1) + 8$

= $12k^2 + 12k + 3 + 8$

= $12k^2 + 12k + 11$

= $[ 12^2 + 12k + 10] + 1$

= $2[ 6k^2 + 6k + 5] + 1$

even + 1



2. If x is an odd integer than x + 2 is odd

   p: x is odd

   q: x + 2 is odd

   p &rarr; q 

   â€‹

   x = 2k + 1, x is odd

   (2k + 1) + 2

   (2k + 2) + 1

   2(k + 1) + 1

   2(k + 1) + 1 is odd

If x is an even integer, then $x^2-6x+5$ is odd.

1. n is even =>

n = 2k

$5(2k)^2 + 3(2k) + 7$

$5(4k)^2 + 6k + 7$

$(20k^2 + 6k + 6)$
