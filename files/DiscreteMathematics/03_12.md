##Introduction

- Sequences are ordered lists of elements
  - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
  - 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, …
- Sequences arise throughout mathematics, computer science, and in many other disciplines, ranging from botany to music.
- We will introduce the terminology to represent sequences and sums of the terms in the sequences.

## Geometric Progression

- A geometric progression is a sequence of the form: $a, ar, ar^2, ar^n$ where the initial term $a$ and the common ratio $r$ are real numbers.

## Arithmetic Progression

- An arithmetic progression is a sequence of the form: $a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d$ where the initial term $a$ and the common difference $d$ are real numbers.

## Strings

- A string is a fininte sequence of characters from a finite set (an alphabet).
- Sequences of characters or bits are important in CS.
- Empty string is $\lambda$
- The string $abcde$ has length 5.

## Recurrence Relations

- A recurrence relation for the sequence {$a_n$} is an equation that expresses $a_n$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence, namely, $a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - 1}$, for all integers $n$ with $n \ge n_0$, where $n_0$ is a non-negative integer.
- A sequence is called a solution
