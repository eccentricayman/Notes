## Proof for Assignment 1 Question 4A

N^2 + 1 is odd if and only if n is even

Step 1 I identify p and Identify q

n^2 + 1 is odd = p

n is even = q

if q is true p is true, 2^2 + 1 = 5, 4^2 + 1 = 17

if q is not true then p is not true, 3^2 + 1 = 10, 5^2 + 1 = 26

~ q > ~p is the contrapositive of p > q so p > q is true

therefore p <=> q is true

even numbers are of the form 2k

odd numbers are of the form 2k + 1

Proof if n is even then n = 2k, and n^2 + 1 = (2k)^2 + 1

4k^2 + 1  -> 2(k^2) + 1 -> even + 1 (2 * a number) = odd

Prove if n^2 + 1 is odd then n is even

contrapositive is if n is odd then n^2 + 1 is even

n = 2k+1 

n^2 + 1= 4k^ 2+ 4k + 1 + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k+ 1), 2* any number is an even number so the n^2 + 1 is even

both sides are true
