## SETS — Chapter 2

- A = {1, 2, 3}
  - List all subsets
    - {1}, {2}, {3}
    - {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {}, {1, 2, 3}
    - |A| = The cardinality of the set A = 3
- $\cap​$ = intersection
- $\cup$ = union
- $\in$ = is an element of
- $\subset$ = a subset of
- B = {1, 3, 7, 11}
  - {1, 3} $\subset$ B says {1, 3} is a subset of B
  - 7 $\in$ B says 7 is an element of B
  - A $\cap$ B = {1, 3}
  - A $\cup$ B = {1, 2, 3, 7, 11}
- The cross product of sets
  - A = {1, 2, 3}
  - C = {a, b}
  - A x C = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)}
  - C x A = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), (b, 1), (b, 2), (b, 3)}
  - Is A x C = C x A?
  - Find A x A, C - X
