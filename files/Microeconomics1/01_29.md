## Average Cost Curves

- AFC falls as a given amount of fixed costs is apportioned over a large and larger output. AVC initially falls because of increasing marginal returns but then rises because of diminishing marginal returns.
- Average total cost (ATC) is the vertical sum of average variable cost (AVC). 
- ATC = AFC + AVC or AFC = ATC - AVC

## Marginal Cost and Marginal Product

- The marginal cost (MC) curve and the average  variable cost (AVC) curve are mirror images of the marginal product (MP) and average product (AP) curves.
- When MP rises, MC falls.

## Long Run Production Costs

- The firm can change all input amounts, including plant size.
- All costs are variable in the long run.
- Long run ATC

## Economies of Scale

- The idea that for a time larger plant sizes will lead to lower unit costs.


- Labor specialization
- Managerial specialization
- Efficient capital
- Other factors
- Constant returns to scale - occurs when ATC is constant over a variety of plant sizes.

## Diseconomies of Scale

- This may occur if a firm becomes too large, as illustrated by the rising part of the long run ATC curve. 
- As the firm expands over time, the expansion may lead to higher average total costs.
- With diseconomies of scale, an increase in inputs will cause a less than proportionate increase in output
- Control and coordination problems
- Communication problems
- Worker alienation
- Shirking
