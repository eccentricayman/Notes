- Total and marginal utility are inverse exponential relationships.
- Brain modularity
- System 1 and System 2
  - **Cognitive biases**
    - Confirmation bias
    - Self-serving bias
    - Overconfidence effect
    - Hindsight bias
      - When you say something will certainly happen and then change your mind, and start making excuses for it.
    - Availability heuristic
      - Likeliness of an even happening, makes you think it's more possible to happen because it's so popularized
    - Planning fallacy
      - When you think/say you have enough time to do something, but you don't.
    - **Framing effects**

## Prospect Theory

- People judge good things and bad things in relative terms, as gains and losses to their **status quo**
- People experience both diminishing marginal utility for gains as well as diminishing marginal disutility for losses
- People experience **loss aversion**, in that they feel losses much more intensely than gains
- **Prospect theory**: 
- Losses and shrinking packages
- Framing effects and advertising
- **Anchoring** and credit card bills
- **Mental accounting** and overpriced warranties
- The **endowment effect** and market transactions
- **Status quo bias**

## Myopia and Time Inconsistency

- **Myopia and time inconsistency**:
- Fighting **self-control problems** with **pre-commitments**
  - Hiding the alarm clock
  - Automatic payroll deductions
  - Salary smoothing
  - Early withdrawal penalties
  - Weight-loss competitions

## Fairness and Self-Interest

- Evidence for **fairness** exists
  - Giving to charity
  - Obeying the law
  - Fixing prices
  - Purchasing the "Fair-Trade" products
- Experimental evidence for fairness
  - The **dictator game**
  - The **ultimatum game**
    - The rules
    - How players behave
    - Why the threat of rejection increases cooperation
    - Implications for market efficiency

# Businesses and the Costs of Production

## Economic Costs

- **Economic Costs**
  - The payment that must be made to obtain and retain the services of a resource.
- **Explicit Costs**
  - Monetary outlay
- **Implicit Costs**
  - Opportunity cost of using self-owned resources
  - Includes a **normal profit**

## Accounting Profit and Normal Profit

- **Accounting profit**

  = Revenue - explicit costs

- **Economic profit**

  = Account profit - implicit costs

## Short Run and Long Run

- **Short run**
  - Some variable inputs
  - Fixed plant
- **Long run**
  - All inputs are ariable
  - Firms can adjust plant size as well as enter and exit industry

## Short Run Production Relationships

- **Total Product** (TP)
- **Marginal Product** (MP)

## Law of Diminishing Returns

- Resources are of equal quality
- Technology is fixed
- Variable resources are added to fixed resources
- At some point, marginal product will fall
- **Rationale**

## Short Run Production Costs

- **Fixed costs** (TFC)
- **Variable costs** (TVC)
  - This is labor
  - Costs that do vary with output
- **Total cost** (TC)
  - Sum of fixed costs and variable costs
