## Price Elasticity of Demand

- Measures buyers' responsiveness to price changes
- **Elastic demand**
  - Sensitive to price changes
  - Large Changes in quantity demanded
- **Inelastic demand**
  - Insensitive to price changes
  - Small change in quantity demanded

## Price Elasticity of Demand Formula

- $E_d = \frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded of product X}}{\text{percentage change in price of product x}}$
- Use the **midpoint formula**
- Ensures consistent results
- $E_d = \frac{\text{Change in quantity}}{\text{Sum of quantities / 2}} \div \frac{\text{change in price}}{\text{Sum of prices / 2}}$

## Interpretation of Elasticity of Demand

- $E_d$ > 1 demand is elastic
- $E_d$ = 1 demand is **unit elastic**
- $E_d$ < 1 demand is inelastic
- **Extreme Cases**
  - $E_d$ = 0 demand is **perfectly inelastic**
  - $E_d$ = $\infty$ demand is **perfectly elastic**

## Total Revenue Test

- **Total Revenue** = Price x Quantity
- Total Revenue Test
  - Inelastic demand
    - Price and total revenue move in the same direction
  - Elastic demand
    - Price and total revenue move in opposite directions

## Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand

- Substitutability
  - More substitutes, demand is more elastic
- Proportion of oncome
  - Higher proportion of income, demand is more elastic
- Luxuries vs necessities
  - Luxury goods, demand is more elastic
- Time
  - More time available, demand is more elastic

## Applications of Price Elasticity of Demand

- Large crop yields
  - Inelastic demand, lower total revenue
- Excise taxes
  - Inelastic demand, more total revenue
- Decriminalization of illegal drugs
  - Inelastic demand, more total revenue
