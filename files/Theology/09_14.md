## Mosaic Covenant

- Mosaic/Sinai Covenant, builds on earlier patriarchal covenant in 3 ways:
  1. The divine name YHWH expresses and invites growing intimacy with God.
  2. Specific , detailed, moral behavior expected of covenant members. Based on Mosaic Torah (especially the '10 Sayings'), this key teaching develops over the centuries.
  3. Sacred Writing becomes a public sign of God's enduring bond with Israel, especially in the Passover/Exodus/Sinai story. Covenant tradition grows increasingly 'biblical'.
