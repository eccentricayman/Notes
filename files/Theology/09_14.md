## Mosaic Covenant

- Mosaic/Sinai Covenant, builds on earlier patriarchal covenant in 3 ways:
  1. The divine name YHWH expresses and invites growing intimacy with God.
  2. Specific , detailed, moral behavior expected of covenant members. Based on Mosaic Torah (especially the '10 Sayings'), this key teaching develops over the centuries.
  3. Sacred Writing becomes a public sign of God's enduring bond with Israel, especially in the Passover/Exodus/Sinai story. Covenant tradition grows increasingly 'biblical'.

## The 10 Sayings

- "The Ten Commandments", which ground all later Mosaic teaching, are far more than a set of rules.
- They are God's invitation, training us to make covenant-true life choices.
- They show us how to live in God's close company, which defines true "holiness", or "heaven".
- They express God's generous aim for us all, and presumes God's constant help in overcoming nearsighted views of what's truly important.
- The 10 'Commandments' appear in 2 versions (exodus 20:1-17; Deut 5:1-22), which differ only slightly.
  1. Exclusive loyalty to God alone.
  2. No physical images of God.
  3. Honor God's intimate name.
  4. Observe "Shabbat".
  5. Respect for parents.
  6. No murder.
  7. No adultery.
  8. No stealing.
  9. No lying; keep your word.
  10. No scheming.
