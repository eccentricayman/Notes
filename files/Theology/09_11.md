## Abraham's Covenant God: A Profile

- Most of the biblical book of Genesis tells 4 generations of family stories about Abraham, his descendants, and their covenant with *El Shaddai*, a Middle-Eastern divinity associated with storms, clouds, rain, and fertility.
- Over time, certain consitent features emerge:
  - Intensely personal, familial engagement
  - Serious promise-making and keeping builds mutual trust
  - This God is demanding, purposive, moral, patient, reliable, generous
  - Unexpected surprises reveal a broad divine plan at work
- All of this escalates in the biblical books of Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, which depict Moses' intensified covenant with God, and its impact as basis for all later covenant understanding.

## Moses and the Covenant of Sinai

- Exodus tells the story of Moses' birth, youth, flight from Egypt, and call by God at Mt. Sinai.
- In a train of events called "the Exodus", or "Passover", the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants through Jacob (="Israel") intensifies dramatically.
