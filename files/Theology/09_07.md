## Patriarchal Covenant Tradition

- Abraham leaves his larger clan, joined by his wife, Sarah, his nephew Lot, and their families and flocks.
- In traveling through Canaan as *habiru*, Abraham encounters local Canaanite rulers and royal Egyptian officials.
- His adventures with his nephew Lot, form the first laer of patriarchal tradition (see Gen 11:27 - 25:11), which continues with stories of his descendants Isaac, Jacob (="Israel"), and Joseph.
