## Revolution

- One complete circling around the Sun.
- From above North Pole in counter clockwise direction.
- The Sun is not in the middle of the plane of the ecliptic.
- **Aphelion**: The Earth furthest away from the Sun (July 4th)
- **Perihelion**: The Earth closest to the Sun (January 3rd)
- The earth rotates from west to east once every 23 hours 56 minutes.
- As the Earth's axis points the same way it remains parallel (parallelism).



# Atmosphere

- Gravity holds our atmosphere in place.

## Gases in the Atmosphere

- Carbon dioxide (CO2) (0.035%)
- Used by green plants in photosynthesis.
- Produced by respiration, burning of fossil fuels.

## Ozone

- In the stratosphere forms the ozone layer.
- Absorbs UV radiation.
- South Pole in spring and summer has no ozone.

## Albedo

- Can either be absorbed (heating) or reflected (no eating).
- It is the percentage of solar radiation reflected.

## Insolation

- 49% = direct radiation (radiation that goes directly to Earth's surface)
- 31% = reflected back to space(3% by scatter, 19% by clouds, 9% by ground)
