## 5 Things That Influence Air Temperature

- Elevation
- Surface
- Latitude
- Insolation
- Coastal vs. Inland

## The Urban Heat Island

- The heat island tends to persist overnight
- Parks can reduce the heating
- Desert urban areas often do not exhibit heat islands, where irrigated vegetation may make the city cooler

## Elevation and Temperature

- Generally temperatures drop with altitude
- Daily temperature range also increases due to decreased greenhouse
- Except Cuzco, that has a heat island

## Maritime vs Continental Climates

- Land heats and cools quickly while water heats and cools slowly
- During a year an ocean surface has a smaller annual range of temperature (maritime climates)
- A land surface has a larger annual range (continental climates)

## Relative Humdity and Temperature

- Relative humidity is the amount of water air can hold at a specific temperature.

## Fog

- Cloud layers at or close to the surface
- Radiation fog forms at night when air near the ground falls below dew point
- Advection fog forms when warm moist air moves over a cool surface
- Sea fog forms when cool marine air comes in contact with the sea

## Precipitation

- Freezing rain (ice crystals freeze onto a frozen surface)
- Snow (ice crystals have not melted)
- Sleet (ice crystals that melt as they fall)
