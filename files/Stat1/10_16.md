## Expectation

- $E = a_1p_1 + a_2p_2 + ... + a_kp_k$
- $a_1 ... a_k$= amounts win/lose
- $p_1 ... p_k$= probability that you win / loes those amounts



## Simple Decision Theory

1. Paid a bonus contingent on the "exact" correct answer, choose the mode
2. Paid base minus a value with relation to the magnitude of error, median (WTF did he write...)
3. Paid base minus a value with relation to the magnitude of the error^2, choose mean.
