## Discrete Probability Distributions

- Random Variables

- | Discrete                                                     | Continuous*                            |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
  | Countable, Countably Infinite, # of students in a class/school/world | Uncountable, Time, Weight, Temperature |

## Probability Distribution Tables

- | Discrete              | Probability P(X)                                       |
  | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
  | All possible outcomes | 1. Be a value between 0 and 1<br />2. $\sum{P(x) = 1}$ |

- ex. One out of every two students in college suffers from math anxiety. If two kids are picked at random, create the probability distribution table for all of the possible outcomes.

- | x(# of students with math anxiety) | P(x)                                      |
  | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | 0                                  | $\frac{1}{4}$                             |
  | 1                                  | $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ |
  | 2                                  | $\frac{1}{4}$                             |

## Binomial Probability Distribution

1. There is a fixed number of trials
2. The probability is the same in each trial
3. The trials are independent

- $p(x) = (^n_x) p^xq^{n-x}$
- p = probability of success
- q = (1 - p) = probability of failure
- n = # of trials
- x = random variable

## Hypergeometric Distribution

- $p(x) = \frac{(^a_x)(^{\ \ b}_{n-x})}{(^{a + b}_{\ n})}$ *without replacement

- 'a' = amount of what we want (sample size)

- 'b' = sample size of failure

- 'n' = number of trials

- 'a + b' = total sample space

- 'x' = random variable

- ### Conditions

  - Probability not given
  - Sampling without replacement (probability not independent)
  - $\mu = \frac{na}{a+b}$
  - $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{nab(a+b-n)}{(a+b)^2(a+b-1)}}$

## Geometric Distribution

- $p(x) = p q ^{x - 1}$

- p = probability of success

- q = probability of failure

- ### Conditions

  - Probability of first success: $\mu = \frac{1}{p}$
