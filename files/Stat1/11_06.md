- Range 42-59
- Probability of a discrete value of a continuous scale is 0.
- Probability of continuous random variables are measured as the area under the curve of a continuous distribution.

## Normal Distribution

- Graph, -2sigma, -sigma, mean, +sigma, +2sigma

## Standard Normal

- mean = 1, sigma = z = 1



- $Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
  - Z Score
- Round off to two decimal places
