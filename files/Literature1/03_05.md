## Points of View for Fiction

- 1st person - "I" the narrator is part of the action, usually it's his/her story. Limited perspective - narration cannot tell us what is going on in another person's mind with certainty.
- 2nd person - "you" talks to the reader or another person, hard to maintain for a story.
- 3rd person omniscient - "He, she, they" - all seeing, all knowing. They can see into everyone's mind, tell us with certainty what they are thinking, "The Boarding House".
- 3rd person limited - but sees into one character's mind.
- 3rd person reportorial - journalistic perspective, Hemingway uses it a lot
- Point of view is almost everything in fiction.

## A & P

- Is Sammy heroic?
- Conformity
- Junk culture

## Cold War

1. Conformity in America - sheep, standard items.
2. Expose the junk culture

- "For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure."

  -Ralph Waldo Emerson

- Robot, automaton, is he happy? Appearances, middle-America values appearance over substance. Smug, arrogant, mean, not introspective, no examination - "The unexamined life is not worth living."
