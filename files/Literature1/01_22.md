   - Aesop's Fables
3. Tale - Short fiction before 1820, strange happenings, written for entertainment not spiritual or moral insight, no character development, events happen swiftly, all about the plot.
4. Modern Short Story - Focuses on primarily one character, shows character development and/or psychological insight.
