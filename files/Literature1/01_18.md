## Characteristics of Good Writing

1. Clarity - Your responsibility as a writer is to make sure the reader understands you.
2. Brevity - To the point, concise, saying as much as possible in as few words as possible. This all starts with verbs. Make every word count.
3. Specificity - Sufficient details
4. Variety - Vocabulary/verbs and sentence structures
5. Integrity - Do not plagiarize, give the paper your best effort

## The Writing Process

1. Pre-Writing/Thinking
2. Writing - Up to first draft
3. Revision - "All writing is rewriting"
4. Proofing

## Poetry

1. Ubiquitous - Everywhere, every culture has poetry
2. Concise form of expression - few words
3. Patient - meaning comes after re-readings, familiar with the connotation and denotation of a word

## Four Questions (To Undestand Poetry)

1. Who is the speaker? (not necessarily the poet)
2. What is the occasion / situation?
3. What seems to be the poem's central purpose? (not the message, all art usually gives us a perspective on a small part of the world ; maybe personal, maybe political)
4. How is that purpose achieved? (the tone, the emotional quality, rhythm, words, images)
