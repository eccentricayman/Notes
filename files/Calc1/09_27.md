## Properties of Limits

- ?

## Derivative Rules

$$
*\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)
$$

- Power Rule
  - Given f(x) = x^n^
  - f'(x) = nx^n-1^

## Applications

1. Tangent lines: A straight line (y = mx + b) that intersects with a function at one and only one point on that function.

- To Solve for a tangent line:
  - Given f(x) and a point (x, y)
  - To be a tangent line to f(x) at (x, y), the slope for the tangent line must be the same as the slope of f(x) at (x, y).
  - Recall slope = f'(x)
  - Take f'(x) and solve given (x~1~)
  - Use the slope from above and point (x, y) and solve for y = mx + b



- Certain functions have no derivatives
- If a function has a derivative at point (x~1~, y~1~), then it is continuous at that point.
- At any corner or cusp, derivative does not exist.
- Corners / cusps appear in piecewise functions.
- To check to see if a piecewise function is differentiable check that the derivative of each piece is equal given the bounds.
