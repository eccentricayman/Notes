## Limits

- The limit of a function approaches a certain value that may or may not exist in the function.

  - $$
    \lim \ f(x) = L\\
    x -> c\\
    \text{C is a constant}\\
    \text{L is defined}
    $$


## Evaluating Limits

- Direct Substitution
  - Plug the value of c into f(x) and see if you get a proper solution.
- Factoring
  - If when you do direct substitution you end up with percent, than they share a factor.
  - Factor both the numerator and the denomnator.
  - Cancel  out the like factors.
  - Substitute again.
- Rationalizing
  - Use direct substitution, if you get 0 as the denominator.

## Continuity

- A function f(x) is said to be continuous if there does not exist a c, such that f(c) is undefined.

##Non Removable Discontinuity 

- lim f(x) will never exist, and x &rarr; c.

## Limits to Infinity

- Infinity is the representation of an idea. It is not a number.

## Rules to Infinity

- For any constant 
  $$
  \frac{c}{infinity} = 0\\
  \frac{infinity}{c} = infinity
  $$
