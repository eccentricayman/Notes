## Derivatives

- The derivative of a function at a given point represents the rate of change of that function at that given point.
  - ex. when driving if the position is given by the function s(t), the derivative is v(t) (velocity), and the derivative of velocity is a(t), acceleration.
- Derivative = Slope
- Derivatives are denoted, given a function f(x) = y, the derivative is dy / dx.
- Definition of Derivative:

$$
\text{lim (h -> 0)} \ \ \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

- The goal is to eliminate the 'h' in the denominator.
- The derivative of a linear function

$$
y = mx +b \\\text{is 'm'}
$$

- The slope of a quadratic functions is a linear function.
- The slope of a polynomial with degree n is a function with degree n - 1.
