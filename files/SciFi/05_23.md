# Aim: How well does the novel meet your expectations of a Hugo winner?



DN: I believe that most of the Hugo winners I have read gave me a sense of awe — awe at the overarching magnificence of the story, or awe at the message being conveyed through the story. While *The Left Hand of Darkness * didn't evoke the same emotion as some of the others, there were still moments where I had become enraptured by the world LeGuin had created. Two specific moments were the legend of the man in the ice, and the description of how the androgynous people had sex. Despite the power behind some of the scenes, they were scarce within the novel. This doesn't serve as a critique of LeGuin's novel, but rather an acknowledgement of the time period it came from — a period where the Hugo Award was something relatively new, and a period where the Science Fiction genre was still being defined.
