​	"The only discipline that lasts is self discipline". Self discipline is what drives us. Motivation is fleeting, temporary — you cannot stay motivated your entire life, and you're lying to yourself if you say otherwise. Once that motivation leaves, for a year, for a month, for a minute — all that remains is self discipline. In that moment, you will be alone - there will be nobody to push you, and you either realize that you're stuck or you continue to work on, powered by whatever self discipline you've managed to muster over your lifetime. It sounds like such a simple task — just discipline yourself into doing work — but coming from someone who's painfully aware of his lack of self discipline, it could either be the easiest or the hardest thing you've ever done.
