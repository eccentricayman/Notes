## Unemployment

- Frictional Unemployment (FU)
  - A person has marketable skills, but is unemployed because they are either switching or in between jobs
  - Voluntary unemployment
- Structural Unemployment (SU)
  - A person no longer has marketable skills and in order to become employed they must re-locate or re-train
  - Voluntary unemployment
- Cyclical Unemployment (CU)
  - This is unemployment that occurs when the economy goes into a recession/depression
  - Involuntary unemployment
- Total Unemployment = TU (9%) = FU (3%) + SU(3%) + CU(3%)
- When CU is at 0, the economy is at full employment

## Interest Rates

- A bank is a place (financial institution or intermediary) that borrows and lends money (it brings together those who have money and those who don't)
- So, the rate of interest is the **price of money**.
- When you put money in a bank, you are lending the bank money (the bank pays you a loan rate, example 1%). The bank uses your money to lend it to someone else (the bank charges a borrowers rate, example 15%) the difference is called the **SPREAD, or profit**.
