## Perfect Complements and Substitutes

- When the quantity demanded for Product X increases, and at the same time the demand for Product Y decreases, what can we say about product X and Y.
  - They're perfect complements.
- If products A and B are complementary, and the price of one of them changes, does the demand or the quantity of demand change.
  - The quantity of demand changes.
