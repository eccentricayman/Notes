## Demand and Supply or Market Equilibrium

- ###Demand

  - Things that will cause consumer to go onto a new demand line.
  - Demand Only
    1. Change in Consumer Taste
    2. Change in Consumer Income
    3. Change in Number of Consumers
  - Both Demand and Supply Lines
    1. Change in Prices of Substitutes and Complements
    2. Change in Future / Expected Price

- ### Supply

  - Things that will cause a business to go onto a new supply line.

  - Supply Only

    1. Change in Technology
    2. Change in Cost of Production
    3. Change in Number of Businesses
    4. Change in Subsidies and Taxes

  - Both Supply + Demand Lines

    1. Change in Prices of Substitutes
    2. Change in Future / Expected Price

## Market Equilibrium

- **Surplus**: When supply exceeds demand at any price
- **Shortage**: When demand exceeds supply at any price
- **Market Equilibrium**: When supply exactly equals demand at one price
- For example:

| Quantity Demanded | Price/Bushel of Corn | Quantity Supplied | +/-  |
| :---------------: | :------------------: | :---------------: | :--: |
|        16         |          $1          |         1         |  15  |
|        11         |          $2          |         4         |  -7  |
|         7         |          $3          |         7         |  0   |
|         4         |          $4          |        10         |  +6  |
|         1         |          $5          |        12         | +11  |



##Reason for Demand and Supply Shifts

| Demand                               |                               Supply |
| ------------------------------------ | -----------------------------------: |
| Consumers' taste                     |                Costs of raw material |
| Consumers' income                    |                           Technology |
| Number of consumers                  |       Number of suppliers/businesses |
| Prices of substitutes & complements* | Prices of substitutes & complements* |
| Future/expected price changes*       |      Future/expected price changes** |
| * **Both lines will shift**          |                    Taxes & subsidies |

- Nothing ever stays the same.
