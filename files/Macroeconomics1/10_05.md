##No Change in Price

- What happens when there's a non-price change (something other than the present price of the product)?
  - The consumer moves onto a new demand line, so the <u>demand</u> changes when the present price stays the same.

1. Consumer's Taste
2. Consumer's Incone
3. Number of consumers who buy the product
4. Prices of substitute or complementary products
5. The Future / Expected Price (Not the present price right now) of the product

## Change in Price

- What happens when he price of something changes?
  - The quantity demanded changes and the consumer stays on the same demand line.
