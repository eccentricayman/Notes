## Divide the Economy Into 2 Parts

- In order to understand how the whole economy works, some economists divide the economy into two major parts.

1. The real economy where goods and services are made/offered.

2.  The financial economy with:

   - money

   - banks and bank branches

     - Most important is the Federal Reserve Bank or FED or Central Bank

     - The FED controls the money supply by using

       1. Discount rate

       2. Reserve ratio or requirement (10%)

          - â€‹

       3. Open market operations

          (Buy government bonds to fix inflation)

          (Sell government bonds to fix unemployment)

   - non-bank branches

- 1 and 2 are connected by the velocity/speed of money.
  - If GDP = $12T and speed of money is 6, then the financial economy/sector should make sure that the supply of money is exactly 2 trillion
  - If &gt; $2T &rarr; Inflation
  - If &lt; $2T &rarr; Recession / Depression
