## Main Features of 2 Explanations (Theories) About How Market Economies/Capitalism Works

- Neoclassical or classical theory
- Keynesian theory named after the economist John Maynard Keynes.

## Neoclassical View

- Long term
- Self adjusting (No Government)
- GDP full employment (always)
- Say's law works (Jean Baptist Say)
- Wages (W) and Prices (P) are flexible downward, meaning they don't fall as easily as they rise

##Keynesian View

- Short term
- Cannot fix itself, needs government
- GDP full employment (never)
- Say's Law does not work
- S != I (i NOT imp.)
- W and P are "sticky"

##Say's Law

- What Say said is supply creates its own demand.
  1. A capitalist decides to invest and make a profit.
